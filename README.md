# rsspopup
Popup latest item of a RSS feed in XBMC any time

Polls a RSS feed and shows the latest item in the feed. Uses the notification box so the popup will appear at any time while using XBMC (also during video playback).

Written on a lazy afternoon by someone who does not know Python, thus use on your own risk.
